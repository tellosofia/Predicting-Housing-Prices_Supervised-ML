# Case Study: Predicting Housing Prices 🏠

## Background 🌐
Explore the use of data to predict housing prices in Ames, Iowa. This case study aims to assist real estate consultants in determining the true value of properties, aiding in decision-making for developers, agencies, and investors. 📊

## Objectives 🎯
The project is focused on predicting housing prices, with two main goals:
- Create a model to predict whether a house is "Expensive" or "Not expensive". 💲💲 → **Classification**
- Create a model to predict the exact price of a house. 📉📈 → **Regression**

## Methodology ⚙️
The project involves:
- **Understand the Context:** Research housing price drivers and market characteristics in Iowa. 🌍
- **Explore & Clean the Data:** Detect inconsistencies, ensure data quality, and transform data as needed. 🧼
- **Data Pre-processing:** Impute missing values, scale data, and engineer/select features for optimal model performance. 🔧
- **Modelling:** Train and compare models to select the best one. 🧠
- **Error Analysis:** Assess model errors to understand limitations and practical applications. 🔍
- **Implement Your Solution:** Report findings or deploy the model for live predictions. 💡

## Tools and Technologies 🛠️
- Programming Language: Python 🐍
- Data Analysis and Visualization: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn 📊
- Statistical Analysis: scikit-learn 📈
- Notebook Environment: Google Colab, Jupyter Notebooks 📒

## Expected Outcomes 📈
The analysis will provide reliable predictions of housing prices, helping clients make informed decisions. Key metrics include model accuracy for classification tasks and prediction error for regression tasks. 🎯
